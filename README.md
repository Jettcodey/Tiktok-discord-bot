# Tiktok-discord-bot
A simple Discord bot that automatically detects TikTok links from an entire channel and saves them in a downloadable text file.

## Permissions

It should work with just the following permissions:
- 'Read Messages/View Channels'
- 'Read Message History'
- 'Send Messages'
- 'Manage Roles'
- 'Attach Files'
- 'Use Slash Commands'

Or just give it admin Permisions ;D (in a Private server ofc)

## Roadmap

- [ ] Send Single Downloaded Video/Image Posts Without Watermark in Channel.
- [ ] Automatically generating a text file after a Specified amount of time has passed.
